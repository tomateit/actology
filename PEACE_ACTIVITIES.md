*   **Documenting and Monitoring Abuses** Civil society organizations engage in **revealing and documenting abuses against civil rights** in the occupied territories. This involves using **field workers to collect material and document testimonies** about human rights abuses. Some organizations stress **impartiality in this documentation**, while others also emphasize the need to **enforce the law by prosecuting and filing cases** against criminals based on documentation.
    *   Organizations: B'Tselem (stresses impartiality), Al-Haq (emphasizes enforcement), Machsom Watch.

*   **Advocacy and Awareness Raising** A common strategy is **advocacy**, which includes **spreading information to relevant decision makers, media channels, other international organizations, foreign administrations, and diplomats**. This also involves **raising public awareness** about human rights issues neglected by political elites and humanitarian problems at checkpoints. Specific tactics include **contacting journalists** and **calling relevant staff in the IDF** when human rights are violated. Advocacy efforts also aim to **promote the equal allocation of state resources** to Arab citizens.
    *   Organizations: Machsom Watch, B'Tselem, Physicians for Human Rights, Al-Haq, Jerusalem Center for Women, Abraham Initiatives.

*   **Resistance** NGOs strive to build a civil peace by **resisting the military Israeli occupation**. This can take various forms, such as **challenging hegemonic understandings and discourses of conflict**, and **resisting the master narratives** (like Zionism). Some organizations have a humanitarian aim that includes **arguing with guards and soldiers**. Resistance can also manifest as **peacebuilding strategies when other avenues are blocked**.
    *   Organizations: Machsom Watch, Breaking the Silence, Zochrot.

*   **Dialogue and Interpersonal Communication** Civil society initiatives facilitate **dialogue and discussion independent of formal negotiations**. Dialogical approaches are used, sometimes modeling themselves on **dialogical storytelling seminars** aimed at therapeutic and trust-building effects. There is a focus on **interpersonal communication**, enabling individuals to engage as a "person," potentially **communicating with victims** or **aiding those who communicate with victims**. Storytelling is seen as a way to **humanize "the other"** and emphasize the shared human dimension in conflicts.

*   **Support and Infrastructure for Peace** NGOs can provide **specialized technical support**, help **build parties' capacities**, and offer their "**good offices**" (prestige and credibility). Mechanisms like MEPPA can support the field by providing **general organizational support**, facilitating **small-scale funding** for emerging initiatives, **professionalizing the field through training** (e.g., mediation, facilitation, conflict resolution), **documenting lessons learned**, and providing **mentoring programs**. Support can also involve assisting organizations with **technical and political difficulties** (like cross-border travel permits), providing **accessible and safe physical spaces** for bilateral meetings, and assisting organizations facing **domestic opposition**.

There is also work to address history through public deliberation and create a "counterpublic of memory". Cultural, literary, and artistic traditions are used to address difficult topics and influence understanding.
    *   Organizations: Peace Research Institute in the Middle East (PRIME), Zochrot.

*   **Organizational Strategy and Collaboration** NGOs utilize strategies like operating mainly on **volunteer work**. **Horizontal cooperation** among organizations is also a key aspect of their work.
